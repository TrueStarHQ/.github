# TrueStar 💫


### 🤔 What it is

A browser extension (in development) that analyzes product reviews to help identify authentic feedback. Built as a transparent alternative to Fakespot after Mozilla discontinued it.

### 💙 Core Values

Transparency, privacy, and fairness are core values. Unlike black-box review analyzers, TrueStar's code is fully open for anyone to view.

### 🤝 Get Involved

The project is still in early development and undergoing rapid iteration. Once it's more stable, I look forward to accepting contributions, bug fixes, and suggestions from the community! In the meantime, please get in touch at [hello@truestar.pro](mailto:hello@truestar.pro) if you have ideas or questions about the project.


#### More to come soon...
